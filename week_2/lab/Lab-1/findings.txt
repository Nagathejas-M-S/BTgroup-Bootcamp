1. The Core Issue: Encapsulation Violation

The lab is designed to demonstrate the difference between direct field 
access (bad practice) and property access (good practice).

AccountManager1 (The "Bad" Way):

It accesses the protected variables directly (e.g., acc._acc_no).
Result: It bypasses the business logic defined in the Account class.
The Account Number is stored as just "004701" (missing the "ICI" prefix).
The Balance is displayed as just 45000.0 (missing the interest calculation).


AccountManager2 (The "Good" Way):

It uses the public properties (e.g., acc.acc_no).
Result: It triggers the business logic defined in the Account class.
The setter adds "ICI", so the Account Number becomes "ICI004701".
The getter calculates interest, so the Balance displayed includes the 8.5% interest.


2.Execution Flow (program.py)
The program runs both managers on the same Account object instance.

Manager 1 runs: It sets the data "incorrectly" (raw values) and prints them.
Manager 2 runs: It overwrites the data using the "correct" setters (adding the prefix) and
prints the calculated balance.


Conclusion
This lab effectively demonstrates why you should use Properties (Getters/Setters)
instead of accessing variables directly. By using AccountManager1, you lose data 
integrity and business rules (like the bank code and interest calculation).
