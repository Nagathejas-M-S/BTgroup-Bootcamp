1. The Bug

Error Observed: TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "NoneType") to str
Cause: The fill_account_data method in AccountManager was empty (contained only 
pass). As a result, the Account object's properties (acc_no, name, balance) 
remained None. When display_account_data tried to concatenate acc.acc_no 
(which was None) with the string "AccNo : ", the program crashed.


2. The Fix

Action Taken: Implemented the fill_account_data method in account_manager.py 
to properly initialize the Account object using its property setters.
Code Change:
def fill_account_data(self, acc):
    acc.acc_no = "004701"
    acc.name = "Nitesh"
    acc.balance = 45000.0


3. Final Status

The program now runs successfully.
Output:
Performing Account Transactions using AccManager...

AccNo : ICI004701
Name : Nitesh
Balance : 48825.0

Note: The balance is 48825.0 because the Account class logic adds 8.5% interest (45000 + 3825). 
The Account Number has the "ICI"
prefix added by the setter.
